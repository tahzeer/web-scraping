# Web Scraping

Web scraping with Beautiful Soup (bs4) and Pandas simplifies data extraction from websites and enables efficient data manipulation in Python.

## Requirements
Before you proceed, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Installing Beautiful Soup (bs4)
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Use pip (Python package manager) to install Beautiful Soup:
   ```
   pip install beautifulsoup4
   ```

### Installing Requests
1. Make sure you have the terminal or command prompt open.
2. Use pip to install Requests:
   ```
   pip install requests
   ```

### Installing Pandas
1. Ensure that the terminal or command prompt is open.
2. Use pip to install Pandas:
   ```
   pip install pandas
   ```

## Verify the Installations
After the installations are complete, you can verify that Beautiful Soup, Requests, and Pandas are properly installed by running the following commands in Python:

```python
import bs4
import requests
import pandas as pd

print("Beautiful Soup version:", bs4.__version__)
print("Requests version:", requests.__version__)
print("Pandas version:", pd.__version__)
```

If the installations were successful, this code should output the versions of the respective libraries.
